% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

Object detection, one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision, is used in numerous real-world applications by enabling machines to identify and locate objects within images or videos. Object detection algorithms aim to address the two challenges of recognizing objects of interest within complex scenes by identifying their spatial extent with bounding boxes, and assigning corresponding class labels. This capability is crucial for a wide range of tasks, including pedestrian detection for autonomous driving, object tracking in video surveillance, and product recognition for inventory management. Moreover, object detection serves as a foundational building block for higher-level computer vision tasks such as scene understanding, semantic segmentation, and action recognition, facilitating deeper insights and decision-making capabilities in intelligent systems.

The emergence of deep learning revolutionized object detection, leading to significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable potential and have been the main research direction in recent years \cite{zou2023object}. While the performance of deep learning-based object detection models has significantly improved, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses a significant challenge to their reliability and security \cite{costa2023deep}. Adversarial attacks involve maliciously crafted perturbations to input data, which can cause deep neural networks to make incorrect predictions or fail to detect objects altogether  \cite{li2019rosa}. In safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, the susceptibility of object detection systems to adversarial attacks can have severe consequences, jeopardizing human safety and privacy \cite{zhang2019adversarially}. Adversarial defence is a critical area of research focused on enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. While deep learning models are typically optimized to maximize performance metrics on clean images, adversarial training aims to increase performance in adversarial scenarios  \cite{costa2023deep}. Despite the importance of adversarial defence techniques, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the number of papers focusing on adversarial attacks compared to defences in the context of object detection. This asymmetry highlights the need for more research efforts dedicated to adversarial defence in object detection, to mitigate the growing threat posed by adversarial attacks and enhance the robustness of deep learning models in practical settings \cite{bai2021recent}.

Despite the recent success, deep learning methods are computationally intensive during training due to the need to process large volumes of data through multiple layers, while simultaneously updating millions of parameters through backpropagation \cite{objDetect}. Therefore, as the models get larger and more complex, efficiency becomes an increasing conern. Efficiency can be measured as any type of reduction of computational resources, such as through memory, processing power, and energy consumption. In this work, the efficiency of the model will be measured in inference time, which is advantageous because it directly reflects the model’s performance in real-world applications, particularly those requiring real-time or low-latency processing. Inference time indicates how quickly a trained model can make predictions, which is critical for tasks like autonomous driving, video-based object detection, or any time-sensitive application. A model with shorter inference time can handle more data in a given period, improving overall throughput and user experience.

Various methods can be employed to enhance CNN efficiency, such as transfer learning, quantization, weight sharing, and pruning. Pruning is a key technique for improving efficiency and comes in two forms: unstructured pruning and structured pruning. Unstructured pruning removes individual weights that contribute little to the network's performance, leading to sparser weight matrices. While effective in reducing the number of parameters, unstructured pruning can result in irregular memory access patterns, making it harder to optimize on certain hardware. In contrast, structured pruning removes entire filters, channels, or layers, resulting in a more compact architecture. This type of pruning not only reduces the parameter count but also decreases the computational load, making it more suitable for real-time deployment on hardware like GPUs or mobile devices. Structured pruning maintains the integrity of the network structure, allowing for faster inference times while maintaining accuracy. 

\section{Background}
\subsection{Object Detection}
To train a CNN model for object detection, a large labeled dataset is required, where each image contains annotations for the objects present, including their class labels and bounding box coordinates. The model is trained by passing input images through a network that extracts features and learns patterns, with the help of techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the error between the predicted and true labels. During training, the CNN learns to detect objects by adjusting its weights to improve both classification accuracy and localization precision, ultimately producing a model capable of accurately identifying and locating objects in unseen images.

\subsubsection{Model}
CNN models for object detection generally consist of a feature extraction backbone and a detection head. The backbone, often a pre-trained deep CNN such as ResNet or VGG, extracts high-level features from images, which are then fed into the detection head to perform localization and classification tasks. Some models, like Faster R-CNN, use a region proposal mechanism, while others like SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) predict bounding boxes and class labels in a single pass. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models take a unique approach by dividing the image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously, making them highly efficient for real-time applications. YOLOv3, in particular, improves upon earlier versions with better detection at multiple scales, making it an excellent model for balancing speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.

\subsubsection{Dataset}
Datasets play a pivotal role in advancing the field of object detection by providing annotated images for model training and evaluation. Many openly available datasets exist online, such as Pascal VOC, ImageNet, and Open Images \cite{zaidi2021survey}. Among these datasets, the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset stands out as one of the most comprehensive and widely used benchmarks \cite{lin2015microsoft}. Its superiority stems from several factors. Firstly, COCO has a diverse range of object categories, encompassing common everyday objects across 80 distinct classes, including people, animals, vehicles, and household items. This diversity ensures that models trained on COCO generalize well to a wide array of real-world scenarios. Secondly, each image in the dataset is annotated with instance-level bounding box coordinates, and class labels for precise training and evaluation of detection algorithms. Additionally, COCO provides a large-scale dataset comprising over 200,000 images split into training, validation, and test sets, facilitating robust model training and unbiased evaluation \cite{lin2015microsoft}. 

\subsection{Efficient Adversarial Robustness}
Many papers have attempted to tackle the problem of making CNNs robust to adversarial attacks, but also making them more efficient in the process. 

\subsubsection{Towards Compact and Robust Deep Neural Networks}
Introduced by Sehwag et al. in 2019, the work "Towards Compact and Robust Deep Neural Networks" evaluated the robustness of CNNs under both structured and unstructured pruning. The authors provide a formal definition of the pruning procedure, encompassing pre-training, weight pruning, and fine-tuning, which clarifies the methodology's effectiveness in achieving compact networks without compromising performance. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain, on average, 93\% benign accuracy, 92.5\% empirical robust accuracy, and 85\% verifiable robust accuracy while achieving a compression ratio of 10×.Their experimental data showed that their proposed method is effective for both pruning methods, but especially for unstructured pruning.

\subsubsection{HYDRA}
In a follow up paper, HYDRA: Pruning Adversarially Robust Neural Networks, is a seminal work that has taken another step to improving the performance of machine learning models. Sehwag et al. developed a pruning method that is aware of the robust training objective. This is achieved by formulating the pruning process as an empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem combined with a robust training objective, which is solved efficiently using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The authors also introduced importance score based optimization, with every weight being initialized with a importance value that is proportional to pre-trained network weights. This change has shown to help with the final performance and speed of SGD convergence over random initialization. Extensive experiments were performed by testing with CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets, and with four robust training techniques: iterative adversarial training, randomized smoothing, MixTrain, and CROWN-IBP. HYDRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both benign and robust accuracy, even at high pruning ratios (up to 99\%). The method shows significant gains in robust accuracy while also improving benign accuracy compared to previous works. 

The flow of HYDRA can be described in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre-training (train with adversarial, without pruning)
    \item Pruning (freeze weights and only update importance score, generate pruning mask)
    \item Fine-tuning (update non pruned weights but freeze importance scores)
\end{enumerate}

The paper was chosen as the foundation of this work, from its excellent performance and extensive documentation. The performance of the pruning algorithm was strong enough to earn second place in the auto-attack robustness benchmark near the time the paper was published, and the paper has been cited 100+ time since the time of publication.




\section{Method}

\subsection{Adapting hydra to object detection}
The HYDRA method is developed for the task of image classification, where only the type of object in the image is recoganized. Often it is useful to learn the location of the objects inside the images as well, which leads to the task of object detection. Therefore, the CNN model was replaced by YOLOv3, and the dataset was replaced by COCO.

\section{Experiments}
In the context of object detection using the COCO dataset, mAP serves as a fundamental metric for evaluating the performance of detection models. mAP quantifies the precision-recall trade-off by calculating the average precision across different object categories. COCO dataset's mAP is typically computed at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds such as 0.5, which is the threshold used in all experiments in the work. Also, a subset of 50,000 images from MS COCO is used to reduce training time.
